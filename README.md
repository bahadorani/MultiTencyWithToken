# MultiTencyWithToken
Multiple databases - complete data isolation
Multi-tenancy means that one instance of the software and all necessary infrastructure serves multiple tenants.
In this project, Users are the common application table but each product has a separate database (in SQL server) and thus complete data isolation and security.
The tenancy is defined in claims of created jwt token.
